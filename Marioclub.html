          Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo starring
          their mascot, Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series
          or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of the greater
          Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for
          every major Nintendo video game console.Mario[e] is a character
          created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the
          title character of the Mario franchise and the mascot of Japanese
          video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video
          games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber
          who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center
          on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has
          access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities.
          Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi. Mario first appeared as the
          player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. Miyamoto
          wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but when he could not achieve
          the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. Miyamoto expected the
          character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo
          appearances; originally called "Mr. Video", he was renamed to Mario
          after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed
          after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then began to star in the Super
          Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically
          acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Since 1992, Mario has been voiced
          by Charles Martinet. After Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch
          off to different genres. These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario,
          role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports
          games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. He has appeared in other
          Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of
          crossover fighting games. Mario has also appeared in various
          animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment
          (voiced by Lou Albano and later Walker Boone), and was portrayed by
          Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. He will be voiced by
          Chris Pratt in the upcoming 2023 film adaptation. Mario is
          near-unanimously considered to be the most famous character in the
          video game industry and an established pop culture icon. Mario's
          likeness has appeared in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing
          and collectible items, and people and places have been nicknamed after
          him. He has also inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media.
          With more than 750 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario
          franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time.[19][20]

        To say Nintendo was the underdog going into 1996 with a cartridge-based
        system to take on the PlayStation behemoth is an understatement. In its
        first 11 weeks, the Nintendo 64 sold 1.5 million units, and by 1998 had
        shipped a whopping 7 million consoles in the United States alone. Fans
        were clamoring to own a Nintendo 64, and for a good reason. So, here are
        the best Nintendo 64 games that contributed to the console's massive
        global success.
